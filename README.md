## Overview

The dataset consists of responses from 630 individuals working or aspiring to work in data-related roles. It covers aspects like location, job title, preferred programming language, and perceived difficulty in entering the field.

The data was cleaned and prepared using Power BI’s Power Query Editor. Multiple columns were split, cleaned, and transformed to create a structured dataset ready for visualization.

Key focus areas included:
- Summarizing demographic trends across locations and roles  
- Comparing average salaries by job title  
- Analyzing tool/language preferences among professionals  
- Measuring satisfaction with work-life balance and salary  
- Exploring perceived difficulty in entering data careers

## What I Looked At

### 1. Survey Demographics
- Country-wise respondent distribution (e.g. US, India, UK, Canada)  
- Age and total number of participants  
- Current job titles and roles  

### 2. Salary & Job Role Comparison
- Average salary by job title (e.g. Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Analyst, etc.)  
- Comparative analysis across different roles using bar charts  

### 3. Tools & Language Preferences
- Favorite programming languages segmented by job title  
- Popularity of Python, R, and others across the dataset  

### 4. Perception & Satisfaction Metrics
- Gauges showing average happiness with work-life balance and salary  
- Donut chart showing how difficult respondents found breaking into data roles  

### 5. Dashboard Design (Power BI)
- Created with card visuals, stacked bar charts, gauges, and donut chart  
- Filters and slicers enable interactive exploration  
- Color palette and layout optimized for clarity and storytelling
